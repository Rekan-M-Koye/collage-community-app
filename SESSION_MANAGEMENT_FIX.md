# Session Management Fix

## Problem

The application was encountering an error: `[AppwriteException: Creation of a session is prohibited when a session is active.]`

This occurred because:

1. UserContext only used AsyncStorage and didn't sync with actual Appwrite sessions
2. SignIn didn't check for existing sessions before attempting login
3. Profile page showed loading/login prompt because user data wasn't properly synced

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced UserContext (`app/context/UserContext.jsx`)

**Key Improvements:**

- Now checks for active Appwrite sessions on initialization
- Syncs with Appwrite's `getCurrentUser()` and `getCompleteUserData()`
- Properly maps Appwrite user data to local user state
- Added `sessionChecked` flag to track initialization state
- Added `setUserData` helper for direct user data updates
- Falls back to cached AsyncStorage data if Appwrite query fails

**New Features:**

- `initializeUser()` - Checks Appwrite session on app start
- `setUserData()` - Directly sets user data (used after login/signup)
- Better error handling with fallback to cached data

### 2. Improved SignIn Flow (`app/auth/SignIn.jsx`)

**Key Improvements:**

- Checks for existing session before attempting login
- If session exists for same email, uses it instead of creating new one
- If session exists for different email, signs out first then signs in
- Properly sets user data in context after successful login
- Better error handling for session-related errors

**Flow:**

1. Check if active session exists
2. If yes and same email → use existing session
3. If yes and different email → sign out, then sign in
4. Fetch complete user data from Appwrite
5. Set user data in context
6. Navigate to app

### 3. Updated SignUp Flow (`app/auth/SignUp.jsx`)

**Key Improvements:**

- Fetches and sets complete user data after successful signup
- Properly initializes user context
- Seamless transition to main app

### 4. Updated Logout (`app/screens/settings/AccountSettings.jsx`)

**Key Improvements:**

- Calls `signOut()` from Appwrite
- Calls `clearUser()` from UserContext to clear local data
- Ensures clean state on logout

### 5. Better Session Checking (`app/App.js`)

**Key Improvements:**

- Added error logging for session check failures
- Handles edge cases more gracefully

## How It Works

### On App Start:

1. UserContext initializes
2. Checks for active Appwrite session
3. If found, fetches complete user data
4. Stores in both AsyncStorage and state
5. If not found, clears stored data

### On Sign In:

1. Validates input
2. Checks for existing session
3. Handles session appropriately
4. Fetches complete user data
5. Updates context
6. Navigates to app

### On Sign Out:

1. Calls Appwrite signOut
2. Clears UserContext
3. Clears AsyncStorage
4. Navigates to SignIn

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Active session on login attempt** - Reuses session if same user, signs out if different
2. **Network errors during session check** - Falls back to cached data
3. **Missing user data** - Properly handles null/undefined states
4. **Session exists but user shows as not logged in** - Syncs Appwrite session with UserContext
5. **Logout doesn't clear state** - Explicitly clears both Appwrite session and local state

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test login with existing session
2. Test login with different account when session exists
3. Test logout and verify clean state
4. Test app restart with active session
5. Test offline behavior (cached data fallback)
6. Test profile page after login
7. Test navigation between tabs after login

## Benefits

- No more session conflict errors
- Consistent user state across app
- Proper session management
- Better error handling
- Offline capability with cached data
- Seamless user experience

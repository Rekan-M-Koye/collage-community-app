    "email": "john@university.edu",
    "university": "Erbil Polytechnic University",
    "college": "Computer Science",
    "stage": "3rd Year",
    "bio": "Computer Science student...",
    "profilePicture": "https://i.ibb.co/xxxxx/image.jpg"  // ← New field
  }

## Next Steps (When Ready)

1. **Database Integration**:

   - When Firebase/Appwrite is ready
   - Store `profilePicture` URL in user document
   - Sync AsyncStorage with database

2. **Post Images**:

   - Use `uploadPostImage()` in post creation
   - Add multiple image support for posts
   - Create image galleries

3. **Chat Images**:

   - Adapt service for chat image uploads
   - Consider smaller compression for chat images

4. **Optimization**:
   - Add image caching
   - Lazy loading for large image lists
   - Progressive image loading

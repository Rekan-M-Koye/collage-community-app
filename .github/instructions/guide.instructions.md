# Project Context and Coding Guidelines
Hello sonnet , so i wanna continue working on this project , my firebase database isnt ready , and idk if i will use it or appwrite , but we can handle some other stuff for now , so leave database related things for later , we can work on the ui and other logics for now
avoid bulk changes , try to keep the changes minimal and focused on the task and dont delete entire files unless necessary

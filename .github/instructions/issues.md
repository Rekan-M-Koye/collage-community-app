home page section.
1- removing a post/reply/chat that has an image doesnt actually remove it in imgbb.com which causes wasted storage
NOTFIXED: Posts and replies already have image deletion working.(they dont work)


2-the search(after been opened so its a different jsx) shows the search and cross sign as black in dark there making them invisible
it still shows all black text and black icons as u see in screenshot 



4-the fiter for stages doesnt show graduate/gradutaed as an option
the filter have gradute option but it cant be scrolled to see it 

5- image download and zoom still doesnt work, completely remove the codes for download/roatate/zoom images we will try another approach later
there is still UI and guides of them delete them in all places not just one (it might be the real issue you were working on a wrong file again)




Chats sections Issues.

2-group settings should save as they are changed not with a save button.
i removed someone and he is still in the group , ig now it never gets saved , and deleting a group chat also doesnt work 

i havent reviewed the rest i will check them later 




8-chaning chat settings should be saved based on user , i switched between 2 accounts and they both got same settings .
still not fixed 
9- mute notifications should be available for everyone in groups and chats not just admins, whoever doesnt wanna get notifications can mute it.
not fixed , the setting is blocked, make notification and mute a seperate part of the chat/group settings 


10- the seen avatar recipt is shown for oldest seen instead of newest seen.
the seen is shown correctly, but now the chats are opposite , new chats go up instead of down.

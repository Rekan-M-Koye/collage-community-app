## Next Steps

### To Complete the Setup:

1. **Create Appwrite Collections**:

   - Create `posts` collection with all attributes
   - Create `replies` collection with all attributes
   - Add indexes as specified
   - Set permissions

2. **Update Configuration**:

   - In `database/posts.js`, replace `'POSTS_COLLECTION_ID'` with actual ID
   - In `database/replies.js`, replace `'REPLIES_COLLECTION_ID'` with actual ID

3. **Navigation Setup**:

   - Add CreatePost screen to your navigation stack
   - Add a button to navigate to CreatePost from Home or a floating action button

4. **Home Screen Integration** (for later):

   - Display posts in a feed
   - Filter controls
   - Search functionality
   - Post cards with type indicators
   - View post details screen
   - Reply/comment functionality

5. **Additional Features to Build**:
   - View single post screen
   - Reply/comment component
   - Edit post screen
   - Delete confirmation dialogs
   - Like animation
   - Share functionality
   - Report/flag system
   - User profile view

## Dependencies

All required dependencies are already installed:

- `expo-image-picker`: For image selection
- `expo-image-manipulator`: For image compression
- `appwrite`: For database operations
- All UI and navigation packages

---

## Notes

- Images are compressed smartly based on their size
- Database functions are ready but need collection IDs
- All text is translatable (no hardcoded strings)
- Form validation is comprehensive
- Error handling is implemented
- Loading states are managed
- The code follows React Native best practices

## Testing Checklist

Once database is connected:

- [ ] Create post with all fields
- [ ] Create post with images
- [ ] Create post with 10 images (max)
- [ ] Try exceeding image limit
- [ ] Test validation (empty fields, too short, too long)
- [ ] Test each post type
- [ ] Test camera capture
- [ ] Test gallery selection
- [ ] Test form cancellation
- [ ] Test in all 3 languages
- [ ] Test image compression quality
- [ ] Test on slow network

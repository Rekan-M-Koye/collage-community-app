## Next Steps

1. Choose backend solution (Firebase or Appwrite)
2. Implement database integration
3. Complete authentication flow
4. Build out main features
5. Add real content to screens
6. Testing and refinement

## Notes

- This is a JavaScript project (no TypeScript)
- All UI text must be internationalized
- Database work is on hold pending backend decision
- Focus on UI and non-database logic for now

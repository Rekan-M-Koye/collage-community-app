# Post Likes Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Functions (`database/posts.js`)

#### `togglePostLike` Function

- **Updated**: Now fully functional
- **Logic**:
  - Fetches the post
  - Gets the `likedBy` array from the post
  - Checks if user ID exists in the array
  - If exists: removes user ID (unlike)
  - If doesn't exist: adds user ID (like)
  - Updates both `likedBy` array and `likeCount` in a single operation
  - Returns the new like state and count

#### `incrementPostViewCount` Function

- **Enhanced**: Now supports tracking unique views
- **Logic**:
  - If `userId` is provided:
    - Checks if user is already in `viewedBy` array
    - Only increments if user hasn't viewed before
    - Updates `viewedBy` array and `viewCount`
  - If no `userId` (guest users):
    - Simply increments the view count

### 2. PostCard Component (`app/components/PostCard.jsx`)

#### Layout Changes

- **Moved stage and post type badges** under the user name in the header
- **Removed separate type badge** section to save space
- **New compact layout**:
  - User avatar and name at top
  - Time and edited status below name
  - Stage badge and post type badge inline (smaller, compact)
  - Post topic directly below header (more prominent)

#### Functional Changes

- **Added state management** for likes:
  - `liked` - tracks if current user liked the post
  - `likeCount` - tracks total number of likes
  - `isLiking` - prevents rapid clicking
- **Added `handleLike` function**:

  - Implements optimistic UI updates
  - Updates UI immediately for better UX
  - Calls the `onLike` callback
  - Reverts changes if an error occurs

- **Added `useEffect`**:

  - Syncs internal state with props when they change
  - Ensures state stays in sync with parent component

- **Updated like button**:
  - Uses local state for display
  - Shows filled heart when liked
  - Red color when liked
  - Disabled while liking is in progress

### 3. Profile Screen (`app/tabs/Profile.jsx`)

#### Added Like Functionality

- **Imported** `togglePostLike` from database
- **Added** `handleLike` function:
  - Calls `togglePostLike` with post ID and user ID
  - Refreshes the posts list to show updated like count
- **Updated** PostCard usage:
  - Added `onLike` prop with handleLike callback
  - Added `isLiked` prop checking if user ID is in `likedBy` array

### 4. Documentation (`database/APPWRITE_COLUMNS.md`)

Created comprehensive documentation for:

- Required Appwrite columns
- Column types and descriptions
- Implementation details
- Usage examples
- Next steps for setup

## Required Appwrite Columns

Add these columns to your Posts collection in Appwrite:

1. **likedBy**

   - Type: Array of Strings
   - Required: No
   - Default: []
   - Description: User IDs who liked the post

2. **viewedBy**
   - Type: Array of Strings
   - Required: No
   - Default: []
   - Description: User IDs who viewed the post

## How It Works

### Like Flow

1. User clicks like button
2. PostCard immediately updates UI (optimistic update)
3. PostCard calls `onLike` callback
4. Parent component calls `togglePostLike(postId, userId)`
5. Database checks if user already liked
6. Database adds/removes user from `likedBy` array
7. Database updates `likeCount`
8. Parent refreshes data
9. PostCard syncs with new data via useEffect

### Visual Changes

**Before:**

```
[Avatar] [Name]
         [Time • Edited]
         [Stage Badge]  [Menu]

[Post Type Badge with big icon]

[Topic]
[Content]
```

**After:**

```
[Avatar] [Name]              [Menu]
         [Time • Edited]
         [Stage] [Type]

[Topic]
[Content]
```

## Benefits

1. **More compact layout** - Stage and type info takes less space
2. **Better visual hierarchy** - Topic is more prominent
3. **Functional likes** - Users can like/unlike posts
4. **Optimistic UI** - Immediate feedback on likes
5. **Unique view tracking** - Each user counted once
6. **Error handling** - Reverts on failure

## Next Steps

1. Add `likedBy` and `viewedBy` columns in Appwrite Console
2. Set proper read/write permissions
3. Test like functionality
4. Implement view tracking when posts are opened
5. Consider adding like animations for better UX

# ImgBB Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ImgBB Service (`services/imgbbService.js`)

A comprehensive image upload service that handles:

- **Profile Picture Upload**: Square (1:1) aspect ratio, 800x800px, 70% compression
- **Post Image Upload**: Landscape (16:9) aspect ratio, 1200px width, 75% compression
- **Image Compression**: Automatic compression to reduce file sizes
- **Base64 Encoding**: Converts images to base64 for API upload
- **Permission Handling**: Requests and manages camera roll permissions

### 2. Profile Settings Enhancement

Updated `app/screens/settings/ProfileSettings.jsx` to include:

- **Profile Picture Display**: Shows current profile picture or placeholder
- **Upload Button**: Plus icon button positioned at bottom-right of profile picture
- **Loading State**: Shows activity indicator while uploading
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate error messages
- **Profile Picture Storage**: Saves image URL to AsyncStorage

### 3. UI Components Added

- **Profile Picture Container**: Centered circular container for profile image
- **Placeholder**: Shows person icon when no profile picture is set
- **Upload Button**: Circular button with plus icon overlaying profile picture
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows during image upload process

### 4. Translations Added

Added support for 3 languages (English, Arabic, Kurdish):

- `settings.profilePictureUploaded`: Success message
- `settings.profilePictureUploadError`: Upload error message
- `settings.cameraPermissionRequired`: Permission error message

### 5. Dependencies Installed

```bash
expo-image-picker - Image selection from gallery
expo-image-manipulator - Image compression and resizing
```

## API Configuration

**ImgBB API Key**: `2b74b47dbff705a8ee383763714dce86`
**API Endpoint**: `https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload`

## How It Works

1. User taps the plus icon button on profile picture
2. System requests camera roll permission (if not already granted)
3. Image picker opens with square cropping enabled
4. Selected image is compressed and resized to 800x800px
5. Image is converted to base64 format
6. Image is uploaded to ImgBB via API
7. Returned URL is saved to user profile data
8. Profile picture updates immediately on screen

## Features

- **Square Profile Pictures**: Enforced 1:1 aspect ratio for consistent look
- **Automatic Compression**: Reduces file size without significant quality loss
- **Optimized Sizing**: 800x800px is perfect for mobile displays
- **Fast Upload**: Base64 encoding ensures reliable uploads
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for users
- **Multi-language Support**: English, Arabic, and Kurdish translations
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during upload process
- **Permission Management**: Handles camera roll permissions properly

## Future Usage

The service is ready to be used for:

- **Post Images**: Use `uploadPostImage()` for posting images in feeds
- **Chat Images**: Can be adapted for chat image uploads
- **Document Uploads**: Can be extended for PDF/document uploads
